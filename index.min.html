I decided to build the system from the ground up using ASP.NET MVC as the backend foundation and a custom client-side jQuery-based framework using techniques learned from the other UI frameworks. I also regularly updated and added to the automated regression testing suite (C# Selenium-based) to make sure the main features of the site were robust anytime an update was released.<div class=clearfix></div><hr style="margin:40px 0"><div class=clearfix><img alt=Spreebird class=logo src=spreebird.png><h2>Local Corporation (Spreebird)</h2><h3>Lead Developer, Architect, Manager</h3></div><div class=expertise><b>Technologies Used:</b><ul style=text-align:left><li>C# & JavaScript<li>ASP.NET WebForms<li>MSSQL 2008 / SSRS<li>jQuery<li>HTML5/CSS (LESS)<li>Web Services<ul><li>Authorize.net<li>Facebook<li>Google<li>Amazon<li>ExectTarget</ul></ul></div><p>I was a founding partner of Screamin' Daily Deals and helped to build a business that was sold to Local Corporation for $12.5M in just 18 months.
