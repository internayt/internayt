Over 30 years of development, architecture, and project management experience. A solution architect and full-stack developer with extensive experience using the Microsoft stack for the backend and many frontend frameworks, including building my own.

I have developed hundreds of applications as the sole developer or leading small teams and co-founded startups, handling all technical aspects of a business. 

My consulting experience, combined with co-founding multiple startups, has given me a deep understanding of business needs and the expertise to work directly with executives and product owners to create a system that efficiently meets their requirements.

Outside my professional life, I enjoy refereeing soccer and basketball and taking road trips with my family. I have been an official for over 15 years and am a certified referee instructor and mentor.
