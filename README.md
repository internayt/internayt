With over 25 years of development, architecture, and project management experience, I have built hundreds of applications and played many roles, from being the sole developer for the entire project to leading development teams. I have also co-founded startups, handling all technical aspects of a business. My consulting experience in many verticals and building companies from the ground up has given me a deep understanding of business needs and the expertise to work directly with executives and product owners to create a system that efficiently meets their requirements.

I am a solution architect and full-stack developer, comfortable working in any application layer, with extensive experience using the Microsoft stack for the backend and many frontend frameworks, including building my own.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy refereeing soccer and basketball and taking road trips with my family. I have been an official for over 15 years and am a certified soccer referee instructor and mentor.
